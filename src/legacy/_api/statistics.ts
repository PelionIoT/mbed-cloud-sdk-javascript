     * @param limit The number of results to return. The default value is 50, minimum 2 and maximum 1000.
     * @param after The metric ID after which to start fetching. This also can be used for pagination as follows.  **Example usage:**  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl  -X GET \\       -H \&quot;Authorization : Bearer &lt;valid access Token&gt;\&quot;        &#39;https://api.us-east-1.mbedcloud.com/v3/metrics?include&#x3D;transactions,total_count&amp;start&#x3D;20170707&amp;end&#x3D;20170829&amp;interval&#x3D;1d&amp;limit&#x3D;20&#39; {    \&quot;object\&quot;: \&quot;list\&quot;,    \&quot;limit\&quot;: 20,    \&quot;total_count\&quot;: 54,    \&quot;has_more\&quot;: true,    \&quot;data\&quot;: [        {            \&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;015d1a589800015e306fffff005374617473000\&quot;,            \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2017-07-07T00:00:00Z\&quot;,            \&quot;transactions\&quot;: 26381        },        .        .        .        {            \&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;015d7c316c00015e306fffff005374617473000\&quot;,            \&quot;timestamp\&quot;: \&quot;2017-07-26T00:00:00Z\&quot;,            \&quot;transactions\&quot;: 25569        }    ] } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  If the parameter “has more” is true, it indicates that the list is not complete and more values are available. You can give the last ID of the list as the value of the “after” query parameter, and you get the next page of values.
